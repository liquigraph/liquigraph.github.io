# Liquigraph

Database refactoring automation for [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com), the leading graph database.

## About

Liquigraph is a [database refactoring](https://databaserefactoring.com/) tool.
It helps you maintain your [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com) database state by defining and incrementally executing migrations.

This project is heavily inspired by [Liqui**base**](http://www.liquibase.org/).
Users will find many similarities in the terms that Liquigraph and Liquibase use.
