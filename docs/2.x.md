# Liquigraph 2.x (Archive)

!!! caution
    Liquigraph 2.x is not maintained anymore. Please upgrade to the latest version.

## Crash Course

Liquigraph executes migrations defined in a single *change log*. These
migrations are actually called *change sets*.

Each change set must define at least 1 migration query in the [Cypher
query language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypher_(query_language)).

Change sets are immutable (i.e. not allowed to change) and incremental
(i.e. executed only once) by default. Liquigraph persists the executed
change sets in the target graph database every time it runs.

See the [detailed section](#detailed-section) to understand the
Liquigraph model in more details.

### The Migration File

Open your favourite editor and define a change log with two change sets as
follows:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<changelog xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="https://www.liquigraph.org/schema/1.0/liquigraph.xsd">
    <changeset id="hello-world" author="you">
        <query>CREATE (n:Sentence {text:'Hello monde!'}) RETURN n</query>
    </changeset>
    <changeset id="hello-world-fixed" author="you">
        <query>MATCH (n:Sentence {text:'Hello monde!'}) SET n.text='Hello world!' RETURN n</query>
    </changeset>
</changelog>
```

These migrations can be run using the [Java API](#java-api), via your [Maven
project](#the-maven-way) or simply using [the command line](#highway-to-shell). Choose the
way that fits your project.

### Java API

Save the migration file at
`${your_project}/src/main/resources/changelog.xml`.

Then, include Liquigraph in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.liquigraph</groupId>
    <artifactId>liquigraph-core</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.3</version>
</dependency>
```

If you want to consume a SNAPSHOT version, you need to add the following
to your POM:

```xml
<repositories>
  <repository>
      <id>ossrh</id>
      <name>Sonatype Snapshots</name>
      <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
      <snapshots>
          <enabled>true</enabled>
      </snapshots>
      <releases>
          <enabled>false</enabled>
      </releases>
  </repository>
</repositories>
```

Finally, running the migrations can be done as follows:

``` java
import org.liquigraph.core.api.Liquigraph;
import org.liquigraph.core.configuration.Configuration;
import org.liquigraph.core.configuration.ConfigurationBuilder;

// [...]

Configuration configuration = new ConfigurationBuilder()
        .withMasterChangelogLocation("changelog.xml")
        .withUri("jdbc:neo4j:http://localhost:7474")
        .withRunMode()
        .build();

Liquigraph liquigraph = new Liquigraph();
liquigraph.runMigrations(configuration);
```

If you want to simulate (also known as \"dry-run\") your migrations
without actually running them, replace `withRunMode()` by
`withDryRunMode(Paths.get(outputDirectory))`, where `outputDirectory`
specifies the path of the directory where `output.cypher` will be
written in.
:::

### The Maven way

Save the migration file at
`${your_project}/src/main/resources/changelog.xml` (see
the above section to learn how to consume SNAPSHOT versions):.

Then, include Liquigraph plugin in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.liquigraph</groupId>
    <artifactId>liquigraph-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.3</version>
    <configuration>
        <changelog>changelog.xml</changelog><!-- classpath location -->
        <jdbcUri>jdbc:neo4j:http://localhost:7474</jdbcUri>
    </configuration>
    <executions>
        <execution>
          <id>run-migrations</id>
          <goals>
            <goal>dry-run</goal>
            <goal>run</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
```

And finally, run:

``` bash
$> mvn clean package
```

### Highway to shell

Save the migration file at `${your_project}/migrations/changelog.xml`.

!!! tip
    **Homebrew** users, skip the following installation steps altogether.
    Specific instructions are
    [here](https://github.com/liquigraph/homebrew-liquigraph).

#### Prerequisites

1.  make sure at least JRE 8 is set up and `java` is included in your
    path
2.  decompress Liquigraph
    [zip](http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/liquigraph/liquigraph-cli/4.0.1/liquigraph-cli-4.0.1-bin.zip),
    [tar.gz](http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/liquigraph/liquigraph-cli/4.0.1/liquigraph-cli-4.0.1-bin.tar.gz)
    or
    [tar.bz2](http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/liquigraph/liquigraph-cli/4.0.1/liquigraph-cli-4.0.1-bin.tar.bz2)
    in `LIQUIGRAPH_DIR`
3.  include `LIQUIGRAPH_DIR/liquigraph-cli/` to your `PATH`
4.  Unix users: make sure `LIQUIGRAPH_DIR/liquigraph-cli/liquigraph.sh`
    is executable

You can now check your installation by executing the following command
(reminder to non-Unix users: replace `.sh` with `.bat`):

#### Running Liquigraph

##### Interactive mode

``` bash
$> cd LIQUIGRAPH_DIR/liquigraph-cli
$> ./liquigraph.sh --help
```

A description should be displayed. Then, simulate the changes (replace
`/tmp` with whatever floats your boat):

``` bash
$> ./liquigraph.sh --changelog "${your_project}/migrations/changelog.xml" \
    --username neo4j \
    --password \ # leave empty (password prompt will appear)
    --graph-db-uri jdbc:neo4j:http://localhost:7474/ \
    --dry-run-output-directory /tmp
# check contents
$> less /tmp/output.cypher
```

And finally, run:

``` bash
$> ./liquigraph.sh --changelog "${your_project}/migrations/changelog.xml" \
    --username neo4j \
    --password \ # leave empty (password prompt will appear)
    --graph-db-uri jdbc:neo4j:http://localhost:7474/
```

##### Non-interactive mode

The above methods will prompt for your Neo4j password. If you wish to
run liquigraph without password prompt (i.e. non interactively):

``` bash
$> touch my_password.txt
# update mypassword.txt to contain your password and chmod appropriately
$> ./liquigraph.sh --changelog "${your_project}/migrations/changelog.xml" \
    --username neo4j \
    --graph-db-uri jdbc:neo4j:http://localhost:7474/ \
    --password < my_password.txt
```

### Definitions

#### Change log

A Liquigraph change log defines a set of migrations (change sets) to
be performed. There can be only one change log as entry point per
project.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<changelog xmlns="https://liquigraph.github.io/schema/1.0/liquigraph.xsd">
    <!-- import "sub-change logs"-->
    <import resource="version_1/sub_changelog.xml" />
    <import resource="version_2/sub_changelog.xml" />
    <!-- and/or define directly change sets-->
    <changeset [...] />
    <!-- [...] -->
</changelog>
```

Both `sub_changelog.xml` files could import change logs and/or define
`changeset` elements. Their root element is also `changelog`.

#### Change set

A Liquigraph change set describes one or more create or update
statement. These statements must be written in [Cypher Query
Language](http://neo4j.com/developer/cypher-query-language/) and are
wrapped **in a single transaction** (1 transaction per change set). A
change set can be run only once (incremental) and cannot be altered
(immutable) against the same graph database instance, by default.
Finally, a change set is uniquely identified within the change log by
its mandatory ID and author attributes.

```xml
<changeset id="unique_identifier" author="team_or_individual_name">
    <!-- 1 to n queries: all executed in 1 transaction -->
    <query>CREATE (m:MyAwesomeNode) RETURN m</query>
    <query>CREATE (m:MyOtherAwesomeNode) RETURN m</query>
</changeset>
```

Both `sub_changelog.xml` files could import change logs and/or define
`changeset` elements.

##### Execution context

An execution context is a simple string, defined at change set level.
A change set can have 0, 1 or more execution contexts (in the latter
case, they\'re comma-separated). For instance:

```xml
<changeset id="hello-world" author="you" contexts="foo,bar">
   <query>CREATE (n:Sentence {text:'Hello monde!'}) RETURN n</query>
</changeset>
```

If no execution contexts are specified at runtime, all change sets
will match.\
If one or more execution contexts are specified at runtime,
change sets will be selected:

-   if they do not declare any execution contexts
-   or one of their declared contexts match one of the runtime
    contexts

##### Change set immutability

As previously mentioned, Liquigraph change sets are immutable by
default (an error will be thrown if they have been altered). That
said, there may be situations where change sets should be run
whenever their contents have changed. When a change occurs, the
change set computed checksum will change and Liquigraph will execute
the changeeset queries.

To allow such a scenario, you just need to add an extra attribute to
the change set element:

```xml
<changeset id="hello-world" author="you" run-on-change="true">
   <query>CREATE (n:Sentence {text:'Hello monde!'}) RETURN n</query>
</changeset>
```

##### Change set incrementality

Liquigraph change sets are incremental by default (they will be
executed only once). That said, there may be situations where
change sets should be run at every execution. To achieve this, you
just need to define one extra attribute:

```xml
<changeset id="hello-world" author="you" run-always="true">
   <query>CREATE (n:Sentence {text:'Hello monde!'}) RETURN n</query>
</changeset>
```

##### Combining mutability and non-incrementality

A mutable change set (`run-on-change=true`) is not going to run
unless its content change.\
Similarly, a non-incremental change set (`run-always="true"`) will
always run as long as it never changes (else an error would occur,
change sets are immutable by default).\
If you need to run a change set all the time and allow its content to
change, then you need to combine both attributes.

```xml
<changeset id="hello-world" author="you" run-always="true"  run-on-change="true">
   <query>CREATE (n:Sentence {text:'Hello monde!'}) RETURN n</query>
</changeset>
```

##### Change set precondition

Change set preconditions act like guards. They make sure that the
change set queries will be executed if and only if the precondition
is met.

A precondition can be simple (1
[Cypher](http://neo4j.com/developer/cypher-query-language/) query)
or compound (with boolean AND/OR operators).

In any case, each of the subqueries/the simple query has to return
**exactly one column named *result*** of type boolean (true\|false).

Note that a precondition cannot modify the database itself: all
changes will be rolled back.

If the precondition fails, an error policy has to be selected
amongst the following choices:

-   `CONTINUE`: ignores the precondition error and skips the
    associated change set execution
-   `MARK_AS_EXECUTED`: ignores the precondition error and marks the
    change set as executed (without actually executing it)
-   `FAIL`: halts the whole execution, reporting the precondition
    error

Here is a basic precondition example (you are right: this is the
dumbest precondition ever):

```xml
<changeset id="hello-world" author="you">
   <precondition if-not-met="MARK_AS_EXECUTED">
      <query>RETURN true AS result</query>
   </precondition>
   <query>CREATE (n:Sentence {text:'Hello monde!'}) RETURN n</query>
</changeset>
```

Here comes a slightly more complicated example:

```xml
<changeset id="contest-winner-selection" author="futuroscope-engineering">
   <precondition if-not-met="FAIL">
      <or>
         <and>
            <query>MATCH (p:User {twitter:'@fbiville'}) RETURN NOT (p.underAge) AS result</query>
            <query><![CDATA[MATCH (p:User {twitter:'@fbiville'}) OPTIONAL MATCH (p)-[:SUFFERS_FROM]->(d:NEURO_DISORDER {name:'photosensitive epilepsy'}) RETURN (d IS NULL) AS result]]></query>
         </and>
         <query><![CDATA[MATCH (p:User {twitter:'@fbiville'}) OPTIONAL MATCH (p)<-[:HAS_PARENTAL_CONTROL]-(parent:User) RETURN NOT (parent IS NULL) AS RESULT]]></query>
      </or>
   </precondition>
   <query><![CDATA[MATCH (p:User {twitter:'@fbiville'}) CREATE (p)-[:IS_OFFERED_FREE_PASS_TO]->(:Location {name:'Futuroscope'})]]></query>
</changeset>
```

##### Change set postcondition

Change set postconditions allow a single change set to be applied as
many times as necessary to complete the migration, by repeating the
change set queries as long as the postcondition is met.

A postcondition can be simple (1
[Cypher](http://neo4j.com/developer/cypher-query-language/) query)
or compound (with boolean AND/OR operators).

In any case, each of the subqueries/the simple query has to return
**exactly one column named *result*** of type boolean (true\|false).

Note that a postcondition cannot modify the database itself: all
changes will be rolled back.

Once the postcondition returns false, the change set is considered
complete.

A repeatable change set can be used to perform a migration on a large
database without risking an OutOfMemoryError because of the large
number of nodes or relationships impacted, by splitting the
migration into smaller batches.

Here is a postcondition example, deleting all relationships in the
database by batches of 10:

```xml
<changeset id="delete-relationships" author="you">
   <query><![CDATA[MATCH ()-[r]->() WITH r LIMIT 10 DELETE r]]></query>
   <postcondition>
      <query><![CDATA[OPTIONAL MATCH ()-[r]->() WITH r LIMIT 1 RETURN (r IS NOT NULL) AS result]]></query>
   </postcondition>
</changeset>
```
